# Java
As we know that java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform. and java is a platform independent language.
